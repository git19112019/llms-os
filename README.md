# LLMs_OS Docker Project Enhanced Blueprint

This `llms-os-docker-project-enhanced.yaml` file serves as a comprehensive blueprint for generating a production-ready LLMs_OS Docker project. It defines the entire project structure, Docker configurations, source code, Docker Compose setups, and various configuration files.

## How to Use This Blueprint

To generate the full LLMs_OS Docker project from this YAML file, you need to use the `generate_project.py` script. This script reads the YAML and creates all the specified files and directories.

1.  **Ensure `generate_project.py` is available:**
    Make sure you have the `generate_project.py` script in the same directory or a known path.

2.  **Run the generation script:**
    Execute the script, providing this YAML file as input and specifying an output directory:
    ```bash
    python3 generate_project.py llms-os-docker-project-enhanced.yaml -o my-llms-os-project
    ```
    (Replace `my-llms-os-project` with your desired project directory name.)

3.  **Navigate to the generated project:**
    ```bash
    cd my-llms-os-project
    ```

4.  **Follow the Quick Start in the generated project's `README.md`:**
    The newly created `my-llms-os-project` directory will contain its own `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to build, run, and test the Dockerized LLMs_OS.

## Key Sections of the YAML Blueprint

-   **`project`**: General metadata about the project (name, version, description, features).
-   **`directory_structure`**: A visual representation of the intended file and folder layout of the generated project.
-   **`docker`**: Definitions for various Dockerfiles (main application, development, mock API).
-   **`source_files`**: The actual content for Python source files within the LLMs_OS application and the mock API.
-   **`docker_compose`**: Configurations for `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, and `docker-compose.monitoring.yml`.
-   **`config_files`**: Content for other configuration files like `Makefile`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, and Prometheus configuration.
-   **`test_workflows`**: Example YAML workflow definitions for testing the LLMs_OS functionality.
-   **`commands`**: Quick start and production deployment command snippets.
-   **`metadata`**: Additional project metadata (author, license, repository, etc.).

This YAML file is designed to be a single source of truth for the entire project setup, allowing for easy regeneration and consistency.
